# Mutex

It is a real-time chat application and multi-platform to be used by many users. Every message is broadcasted to every connected chat user. This system is developed in order to enhance the communication among the students and teachers via network so that this will be easy for the discussions related to their studies. In our system, only CR and VCR can communicate with teachers but the other students of their class can only view their chats. All students of their class are engaged in a single room where only two of them can communicate with the respective subject teachers. Each and every student of the class can view the message and announcement made by the teacher. The system is designed in such a way that the students can quickly obtain the information shared by the teachers and can communicate with each other in a user-friendly way.
